# Select Layers by Color (Sketch Plugin)

This plugin has two functions: select all layers that have the same fill color as the currently selected layer/s (command shift f), or select all layers that have the same border color as the currently selected layer/s.
Can be used to combine colors that are visually very similar.

## How to Install

[Download the plugin](https://github.com/kwalker3690/Sketch-Select-Layers-by-Color/archive/master.zip). Navigate to Sketch, and go to Plugins > Reveal Plugins Folder... Unzip the downloaded zip file, and drag the "SelectLayersBy" folder to the Sketch Plugins Folder. That's it! It should show up in the Plugins dropdown and be activated with the keyboard shortcuts.
